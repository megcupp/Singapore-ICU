Analysis of ICU admission and billing data from Singapore

Project title
The health economic burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases on intensive care services in Singapore 2010-2015

Despite the epidemiological transition from infectious to chronic conditions and global increase in critical care admissions, the prevalence of non-communicable disease (NCD) events requiring intensive care services has not been described. We explored and described critical care admissions in Singapore through a retrospective cross-sectional study.
