Analysis of ICU admission and billing data from Singapore

The health economic burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases on intensive care services in Singapore 2010-2015

Despite the epidemiological transition from infectious to chronic conditions and global increase in critical care admissions, the prevalence of non-communicable disease (NCD) events requiring intensive care services has not been described. We explored and described critical care admissions in Singapore through a retrospective cross-sectional study.

Data was collected from the billing databases of three Singaporean hospitals and linked with the electronic medical records (EMRs) of patients over 21 years of age admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) between January 1st, 2010 and December 31st, 2015. Data was explored and described by year, with the significance of changes over time assessed according to data type. Modelled predictors of hospital costs were analysed through linear regression.
